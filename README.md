# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a Python-based project for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression. The project involves data cleaning, visualization, and model building to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset to determine which factors influenced passenger survival. We use logistic regression, a statistical method for binary classification, to predict the outcome (survival or not) based on various passenger attributes.

### Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Handling missing values in features such as 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked'.
   - Converting categorical variables (e.g., 'Sex', 'Embarked') into numerical format using encoding techniques.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualizing the distribution of passengers based on features like age, sex, and class.
   - Understanding relationships between variables and survival rates through plots and graphs.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Implementing logistic regression using `scikit-learn` to model the probability of survival.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for robust evaluation.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Calculating the accuracy of the logistic regression model.
   - Generating confusion matrices and other metrics to assess model performance.
